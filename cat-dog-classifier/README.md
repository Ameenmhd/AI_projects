# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classification

## 📘 Overview
This project is a deep learning model that classifies images of cats and dogs.  
It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to achieve high accuracy on the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset.

---

## 🧠 Objective
To develop an image classifier that can correctly predict whether a given image contains a **cat** or a **dog**.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook
